          I am a BIT (Hons) undergraduate specializing in Networking and Mobile
          Computing with strong experience in full-stack development, system
          support, and networking fundamentals.

          I have worked on projects ranging from Micro SaaS platforms and
          AI-based systems to mobile and web applications, with hands-on
          experience in CI/CD workflows and practical problem-solving.

          I am currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my
